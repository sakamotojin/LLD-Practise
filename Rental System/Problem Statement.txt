We are starting a new vehicle rental service, called SumoCar. In this service, we will rent different kinds of vehicles such as cars, bikes, and trucks. You can book a vehicle for different slots in a day. Each day has 4 slots viz. MORNING, AFTERNOON, EVENING, NIGHT. 

We have limited inventory for each type of vehicle. Also, every vehicle has some rent price associated with it depending on the day slot when it is rented.

User comes to our platform, and asks for a vehicle having different parameters for the query. User queries can look like:
Available vehicles for the given slot
Filter the results based on the vehicle type
Sort the results based on price
Any combination of the above queries

Post querying, user can request the following:
Book vehicles for a time slot

Expectations :
You are expected to write a function, which takes in the above query parameters, and returns the list of vehicles with the required metadata (vehicle price, type)
User can book a vehicle for a time slot, and that particular vehicle won't be available for booking for that given time frame
You are NOT expected to write any REST api for the same
You are NOT expected to read inventory inputs from the command line. Read the initial inventory inputs from a resource file


Bonus :
Handle Cancellation of bookings
